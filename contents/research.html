	<h3>Research</h3>

<div class="intro">
<p>Our research focuses on Computational Molecular Design and Biomarker Detection in Metabolomics, which involves the development of new algorithms and tools to identify and design molecular structures for the targeted use. Our research is published in international journals of Molecular Structure Design, and are presently being used in the development of clinical biomarkers in both Taiwan and the U.S.</p>
<p>Our laboratory was involved in six drug development projects in the National Research Program for Biopharmaceuticals (NRPB). Our research is not only intended to be included in the "Platform for lead optimization and preclinical safety screening project" for years to come, but also to contribute to the National Science Technology Program for Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals in collaboration with departments of chemistry and pharmacy of various domestic universities in Taiwan. Our partners include China Medical University, National Taiwan University, National Chiao Tung University, Taipei Medical University, National Tsing Hua University and National Chung Cheng University. Our primary objective is to rapidly develop new new drugs for the treatment of neuropathic pain, and as well as antithrombotic and cancer fighting agents.. We currently hold several drug patents in the U.S.S.</p>
<p>The Structure-Based Fragment Hopping For Lead Optimization and Improvement method (U.S. Patent), performs a series of virtual screening for compounds in order to uncover the relationship between quantitative determinations such as physicochemical properties or theoretical molecular descriptors and functions. It furthermore optimizes the compound's structure to improve its activity as well as reduce its toxicity. In addition to NRPB's funding, we have also received commissions to develop new drugs from the BioMedical Technology and Device Research Laboratory, Industrial Technology Research, Institute of Medical and Pharmaceutical Industry Technology and Development Center. Our technology includes computational prediction of toxicity: hERG prediction models, prediction and mechanistic interpretation of human oral drug absorption, QSAR analysis of skin penetration and skin penetration enhancers, and QSAR models for skin sensitization. These models are provided by the Drug Research Center in National Taiwan University. We have cooperated with the Bacterial Foodborne Pathogens and Mycology Research Unit to help decrease food toxicity. The project novel preclinical prediction of absorption, distribution, metabolism and toxicity, is continued at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and is also applied in the analysis of nanotoxicity in cells.</p>
<p>In Metabolomics, we have built a research group in National Taiwan University and at the Metabolomics Core Laboratory in the NTU Center of Genomic Medicine. We were awarded Best Informatics paper for the computational method developed in Metabolomics in the Seventh International Conference of the Metabolomics Society. In terms of metabolomics analysis for different cases, we usually not only receive the clinical samples from international sources, but also metabolomicdata that are unable to be analyzed by other universities around the world.</p>
<p>It is hard for computational methods to be approved through experimentation. However, the Mass Spectrometry computing and the NMR computing methods that we have developed in the field of Metabolomics have been published in the journal "Analytical Chemistry",which is the most prestigious journal in the field of analytical chemistry.</p>
<p>The Mass Spectrometry computing and the NMR computing techniques are successfully applied to the study of workers'exposure to welding fumes as well as compound identification in Chinese herbs, prediction of toxicity in Chinese herbs, and to the study of hypoxia's influence on breast cancer cells. In addition, they are applied to finding molecular markers for lung cancer and Leukemia, predicting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis, acute lung injury, sepsis multiple organ failure and the mortality of patients receiving ECMO in the Intensive Care Unit. Moreover, they are used for many other national projects, such us studies on bariatric surgeries in Gastric &amp; Intestine Surgery and studies supported by the Nation Science Council. For instance: on exercise prescription, myocardial functions after cardiac resuscitation, diabetes, or disease mechanisms caused by various metabolic syndromes.</p></div>
