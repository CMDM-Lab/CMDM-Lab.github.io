        <h4>Mutagenicity in a Molecule: <br>Identification of Core Structural Features of Mutagenicity Using a Scaffold Analysis</h4>
        <p>With advances in the development and application of Ames mutagenicity in silico prediction tools, the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) has amended its M7 guideline to reflect the use of such prediction models for the detection of mutagenic activity in early drug safety evaluation processes. Since current Ames mutagenicity prediction tools only focus on functional group alerts or side chain modifications of an analog series, these tools are unable to identify mutagenicity derived from core structures or specific scaffolds of a compound. In this study, a large collection of 6512 compounds are used to perform scaffold tree analysis. By relating different scaffolds on constructed scaffold trees with Ames mutagenicity, four major and one minor novel mutagenic groups of scaffold are identified. The recognized mutagenic groups of scaffold can serve as a guide for medicinal chemists to prevent the development of potentially mutagenic therapeutic agents in early drug design or development phases, by modifying the core structures of mutagenic compounds to form non-mutagenic compounds. In addition, five series of substructures are provided as recommendations, for direct modification of potentially mutagenic scaffolds to decrease associated mutagenic activities.</p>

        <h4>An efficient and robust fatty acid profiling method for plasma metabolomic studies by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry</h4>
        <p>Targeted metabolomic analysis of fatty acids has linked the dysregulation of fatty acids to many diseases. This study selected five frequently used fatty acid derivatization methods for comparison.We compared the method precisions and derivatization efficiencies, the most economical and best performing method was subjected to method validation. Twenty-four fatty acid standards were used to validate the method, which was later applied to the investigation of potential fatty acid markers of breast cancer.The acetyl chloride method was demonstrated to provide the best derivatization efficiency and lowest cost for plasma samples. The ionic liquid column successfully separated positional and geometric fatty acid isomers within 26min under the optimized conditions. Intra-day and inter-day CVs for most of the fatty acids were &lt10%. Over 90% of the results showed recoveries within 85%-115%. The validated method was applied to investigate potential fatty acid markers of breast cancer. The fatty acid profiling results revealed that 3 fatty acids (C22:0, C24:0, C18:2n6) were significantly lower in both pre- and post-menopausal breast cancer patients (P&lt0.05).We demonstrated that the proposed method is an accurate, efficient and economical method for plasma metabolomic studies of fatty acids.</p>

        <h4>A portable micro gas chromatography system for volatile compounds detection with 15ppb of sensitivity</h4>
        <p>Existing non-invasive lung cancer diagnostic equipment has difficulty in detecting early stage lung cancer as abnormal tissue is smaller than 0.5cm in size. According to studies showing that volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from human breath gas can provide biomarkers for human disease, especially for lung cancer, a non-invasive method was developed to measure the exhaled air from cancer patients using chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). However, traditional GC-MS equipment is very expensive and requires specialists to operate. In this research we demonstrate a portable micro gas chromatography (μGC) system to overcome the limitations of conventional methods and realize small chips for big data.</p>

        <h4>Using the Matrix-Induced Ion Suppression Method for Concentration Normalization in Cellular Metabolomics Studies</h4>
        <p>Studies of the cell metabolome greatly improve our understanding of cell biology. Currently, most cellular metabolomics studies control only cell numbers or protein content without adjusting the total metabolite concentration, mainly because of the lack of an effective concentration normalization method for cell metabolites. This study proposed a matrix-induced ion suppression (MIIS) method to measure the total amount of cellular metabolites by utilizing flow injection analysis coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (FIA-ESI-MS).We used series dilutions of HL-60 cell extracts to establish the relationship between cellular metabolite concentration and the degree of ion suppression of the ion suppression indicator, and a good correlation was obtained between 2- and 12-fold dilutions of cell extracts (R2 = 0.999). Two lung cancer cells, CL1-0 and CL1-5, were selected as the model cell lines to evaluate the efficacy of the MIIS method and the importance of metabolite concentration normalization. Through MIIS analysis, CL1-0 cells were found to contain metabolites at a concentration 2.1 times higher than in CL1-5, and the metastatic properties of CL1-5 could only be observed after 2.1-fold dilution of CL1-0 before metabolomic analysis. Our results demonstrated that the MIIS method is an effective approach for metabolite concentration normalization and that controlling metabolite concentrations can improve data integrity in cellular metabolomics studies.</p>

        <h4>Synthesis and inhibitory effects of novel pyrimido-pyrrolo-quinoxalinedione analogues targeting nucleoproteins of influenza A virus H1N1</h4>
        <p>The influenza nucleoprotein (NP) is a single-strand RNA-binding protein and the core of the influenza ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particle that serves many critical functions for influenza replication. NP has been considered as a promising anti-influenza target. A new class of anti-influenza compounds, nucleozin and analogues were reported recently in several laboratories to inhibit the synthesis of influenza macromolecules and prevent the cytoplasmic trafficking of the influenza RNP. In this study, pyrimido-pyrrolo-quinoxalinedione (PPQ) analogues as a new class of novel anti-influenza agents are reported. Compound PPQ-581 was identified as a potential anti-influenza lead with EC50 value of 1 μM for preventing virus-induced cytopathic effects. PPQ produces similar anti-influenza effects as nucleozin does in influenza-infected cells. Treatment with PPQ at the beginning of H1N1 infection inhibited viral protein synthesis, while treatment at later times blocked the RNP nuclear export and the appearance of cytoplasmic RNP aggregation. PPQ resistant H1N1 (WSN) viruses were isolated and found to have a NPS377G mutation. Recombinant WSN carrying the S377G NP is resistant to PPQ in anti-influenza and RNA polymerase assays. The WSN virus with the NPS377G mutation also is devoid of the PPQ-mediated RNP nuclear retention and cytoplasmic aggregation. The NPS377G expressing WSN virus is not resistant to the reported NP inhibitors nucleozin. Similarly, the nucleozin resistant WSN viruses are not resistant to PPQ, suggesting that PPQ targets a different site from the nucleozin-binding site. Our results also suggest that NP can be targeted through various binding sites to interrupt the crucial RNP trafficking, resulting in influenza replication inhibition.</p>
